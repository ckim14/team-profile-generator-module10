# team-profile-generator-module10

## Description:

This application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person using the node.js command-line. Tests were written for each part of the code using Jest.

Once team members inputs are collected, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
